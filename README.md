# Image_Encryption_Decryption_webApp
The Image Encryption project focuses on securing digital images using cryptographic techniques to prevent unauthorized access. The system allows users to upload an image, encrypt it using a custom algorithm, and later decrypt it back to its original form. The project aims to protect sensitive visual data by converting the image into unreadable.
